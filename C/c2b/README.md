# 61C Spring 2022 Project 2: CS61Classify

Spec: [https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj2/](https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj2/)

TODO: describe what you did
First of all, the first project 2A part didn't take as long as I thought. I was able to finish the last part, which was the most difficult, in due date. However, the 2B part which is harder part make me feel I'm at the hell. There was a bug and I visited Venus for debugging. Also, it took a lot of time to find the debug. Each part of the 2B took about two days on average. As for bugs, there were many parts where the value was not correct, but I was confused when I didn't write it down in a note at first, but after writing it down, there were less mistakes than before, so it was okay. The most difficult part was the last part to combine them all. I really didn't know what to do, and it was like hell. The most interesting and easy part was the 2A part. Of course, the boring part was the 2B part.
